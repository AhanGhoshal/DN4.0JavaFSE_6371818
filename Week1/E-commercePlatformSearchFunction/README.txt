->Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.

Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time as the input size grows. It helps in analyzing the scalability and performance of algorithms.

For example:
O(1): Constant time

O(n): Linear time

O(log n): Logarithmic time

O(n log n), O(n^2), etc.



->Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

Best Case: The target item is found early.

Average Case: The target is found somewhere in the middle.

Worst Case: The target is the last item or not found.

Search Type:	Best Case  |   Average Case  |	 Worst Case
Linear Search:	    O(1)	 |           O(n)	     |	      O(n)
Binary Search:	    O(1)	 |        O(log n)	     |	    O(log n)



->Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

Search Type:   Time Complexity | Sorted Required 
Linear Search:          O(n)           |      NO              
Binary Search:      O(log n)         |      YES       



->Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

Binary Search would be more suitable for this platform compared to Linear Search technique.
Because:
*Much faster (especially for large, sorted product lists)
*Optimal for scalable e-commerce platforms
