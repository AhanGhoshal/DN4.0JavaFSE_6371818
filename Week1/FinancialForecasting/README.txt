->Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.


Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Each recursive call should move the problem toward a base caseâ€”a simple scenario where the recursion stops.

Recursion can simplify certain problems by:
1. Breaks Down Complex Problems
2. Natural Fit for Hierarchical or Tree Structures
3. Clean and Elegant Code



->Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.


Here, each recursive call reduces years by 1. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n) of this recursive algorithm.



->Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.


The recursive solution can be optimized by using tail recursion techniques or by using iterative approaches which avoids call stack overflow.
